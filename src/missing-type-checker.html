    <h1><a href="/missing-type-checker">Python's missing runtime type checker</a></h1>
    <main>
        <p>
            Python's typing module doesn't make python a statically typed language.
            The interpreter is still the same duck-typed goo that we all love.
        </p>
        <p>
            The interpreter doesn't have any special knowledge about the types in the <code>typing</code> module.
            It <i>semantically ignores</i> all type annotations in code.
        </p>
        <p>
            Take the following snippet -
        </p>
        <pre><code>names: typing.List[str] = ["guido", "tim", "barry"]</code></pre>
        <p>
            From the perspective of the interpreter, the object pointed to by <code>names</code> is a <code>list</code>.
            There's no discrimination based on the specific container type.
            <code>typing.List&lt;typing.Any&gt;</code>, <code>typing.List&lt;int&gt;</code> and <code>typing.List&lt;bool&gt;</code>
            are all the same <code>list</code> type, internally.
        </p>
        <p>
            Which is the reason why the following (surprisingly) raises a <code>TypeError</code> -
        </p>
        <pre><code>isinstance(names, typing.List[str])</code></pre>
        <p>
            This is all very unfortunate. All that work spent on annotating thousands of lines of code,
            and its basically useless at runtime? (Well, except <code>NamedTuple</code> and friends)
        </p>
        <p>
            This is exactly what <a href="https://typeguard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#checking-types-directly">Typeguard</a> claims to be able to fix.
        </p>
